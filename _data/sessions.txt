1 slot still available. (Saturday Morning-ish)
Risen, a Scion game for 4-5 Players.
I'm unsure of the time as of now, and I'll need some player input to give my full details.
If you're interested, please comment below, and tell me a little of what you think of this new world, the gods, and what you've become
Here's the intro:
"Gods are not what we thought. I don't know how to explain them aside from saying that they are the machine that runs this world. History has painted their tales for us in a million different ways. While it wasn't a lie, the stories were meant to help us understand the scale of these world powers, and NOT to humanize them.
Over the course of the past decade, strange structures have simply appeared, often displacing or killing thousands of people in the process. Near Italy, there was a huge tower that literally rose over night. Here in America, we've seen everything from great temple to factory-looking structures. People have said that these are the gods.
It seems they've come searching for something to match their powers. Since the first structure rose, some people have been oddly affected. They've gained abilities that have never been seen before. These people can be really scary. Others often act strangely around them. Many of these people have often died trying to obtain power.
They, we really, seem to have this ambition. Maybe it's even a hunger. I can't really describe it, but as these powers came to me, I've wanted more. I've reached further and further, but the world seems to be closing to me. I don't think I can live this way much longer. I hope, whoever you are, you find a way to accept this world. I wish I could."

Saturday 12pm
Thy Breakfast Guild (5th ed D&D) - Saturday at noon - in a small village of Podunkus, five fantasy reskins of high school stereotypes are "thrown into detention", being forced to take care of the village's dastardly goblin problem.
Players: Will Malkus (called dibs like three months ago) and four others.

===========================
Saturday 4pm 
Mansions of Madness

===========================
4-5 players. Saturday evening (4/5pmish). Run time approximately 5 hours (not a "Long Shot")
I'll run Fate Roulette. 6 settings/genres sealed in envelopes. One is drawn randomly by die roll (d6). Once the setting is revealed, the players decided and vote on the main conflict and which side they are on. After that, 1 hour to make characters while I spend that time slapping together a plot. Then, we play.
Example: 
Setting: Sci-fi space
Conflict: Browncoats fighting Alliance for independence. Need to capture Alliance General to stop conflict. 
Player Side: Plucky band of freedom fighters with Brownish coats.

===========================
SATURDAY EVENING, 5PM
HAIL SATR REDUX
The Young Gods have ascended, praise their names! Unfortunately for everyone and everything involved, the God of Justice picked up a new friend: a Fallen angel in a silver coin. Six years since Heller (praise him) ascended and disappeared into his domain, six years since the Silver Star temples were burned in Afghanistan, the Silver Heresy is beginning to crop up in strange parts of the world.
You play a task force brought together by the Stargazer Holy Council, tasked with rooting out, destroying, and, preferably, converting these heretics back to the mother church. With you is Counselor Tareq, high priest of the Black Stars, there to protect you from the influence of Heller (praise him) and to assist in conversion efforts.
Player cap of 8, preference given to previous Stargazer players, let me know if you have a concept or if you need a pre-gen

===========================
We be Goblins (You be Food!) is an adventure for 4-5 players.
The Licktoad goblins of Brinestump Marsh have stumbled upon a great treasure—fireworks! Yet unfortunately for them, the tribe member responsible for the discovery has already been exiled for the abhorrent crime of writing (which every goblin knows steals words from your head). To remedy this situation, the Licktoads’ leader, His Mighty Girthness Chief Rendwattle Gutwad, has declared that the greatest heroes of the tribe must venture forth to retrieve the rest of the fireworks from a derelict ship stranded in the marsh.
There will be: Merriment, Fireworks, Team Building Exercises (as devised by Goblins), Songs
There will not be: Non-Evil PCs, OC Self Inserts, Cliffhangers, Mercy (asked, nor given)
5 Pre-gen Characters Provided, New players are welcome, this is not "Consult table 6-1 B for how to interrogate a Mummy-Lord" Pathfinder.

===========================
Sunday Noon. Delta Green (Side Jobs). 
4-6 players. Call of Cthulhu.
*This is not part of my main Delta Green campaign, but this mission will be worked into that larger plot. DG players welcome.
Delta Green is a Top Secret organization created by the US government to combat nightmarish creatures and stop apocalyptic events. Agents use their wit, perception, insight and at times, large amounts of fire power to destroy threats against the world.
A game with potential high lethality where teamwork, planning, and decisive actions are the key to victory. More to follow.

BIOPUNK: The Meatspace Odyssey Continues
I will continue refining and adding crunch to the biopunk system / world I began for the previous event.
Description Excerpt:
"The popular use of inorganic materials to construct the majority of our world is an OUTLANDISH proposition, purely for academic consumption! Genetic engineering is civil engineering. Biohacking is tinkering with your vehicle. Nevermind metal alloys, electricity carried through miles of cable networks, and the sheer insanity of developing silicon transistors when neurons are there for the taking. Preposterous! What sort of civilization never learned to harness the biosystems they were given? A roadmap to the world of tomorrow is literally in the palm of your hand.
Humanity never slid down the hill of machinery, and instead embraced the manipulation of living cells to define their mainstream technologies."
We've discovered that North America has developed as a largely nomadic society, based on energy consumption needs and available technology. Transient power plant owners are the ruling class, being the only groups with the resources to bootstrap new large-scale power plants.
This time, we will focus on a verdant metropolis; a city which has managed to continuously produce usable energy without completely devastating the local ecology. Under the thumb of the ruling elite, you will play a group of biotech anarchists, raging against the meat machine of injustice. Power to the people!
EDIT: Sunday, noon. 4-5 players. Pregens. FATE-based.

===========================
[Sunday at noon, 4-8 players, freeform larp, no prep needed]
I'm going to run at least one 2-hour larp, ideally two. For my first offering, I'd like to bring back my absolute favorite larp, Sign.
"Nicaragua in the 1970s had no form of sign language. If you were deaf, you had simple gestures with a trusted few, likely nothing more than a form of pantomime you negotiated with your family to meet basic needs. In 1977, something happened. Fifty deaf children from across the country were brought together to an experimental school in Managua. Without a shared language to express themselves, the children did the only thing they could -- they created one. In Sign, we follow a small piece of their journey."
In short, I need 3-8 people who want to create a language from scratch, activating a new space in their brain, and being playful children while they are at it.
If you played last time, you are welcome to play again, but preference given to newcomers.

===========================
Silence of the Gods (5th ed D&D) - Sunday, 11a-5p:
In the Glorious Empire of Starlight, the gods' servants have always reigned supreme. It was with the divine blessings that we have always crushed heathens and pagans, forcing them to acknowledge the glory of true gods, casting away their false idols. This was to last until the final days...
But yesterday, something happened. On the holy first day of the year, the gods went silent.
We few chevalier had found always been considered... unconventional. We earned favor by emulating the gods, rather than worshiping through prayer and prostration. And now, only we can trek into the sunless lands, and find again the voices of our pantheon.
Five players wanted, pregens provided.

===========================
Camp Kipakriptid
Sunday 11 AM. 3-5 players. Chronicles of Darkness.
Its a pretty typical summer camp. A little run down, a little cheesy, but you've got activities, a lake, and plenty of space to run around. Only a couple of odd things really. The first is that everyone here is either a warlock, a chupacabra, or some other kind of thing that's off-model from your packaged human. The second is that summer here never really seems to end. There's no calendars, and no one ever knows the date, but some campers have been here way longer than a couple months. The days just go on, one after another, full of outdoor fun, until eventually you realize you're never going to leave. You either accept it and put on a bigger camp t-shirt when you grow out of your old one, or you take up smoking with the other cool monsters and start planning your escape. Thing is, no one's ever done it, at least not that you've heard of. Everybody's got a campfire story, but they all end badly. You know there has to be a way though, and piecing together those stories is going to tell you how.

============================
VTM: Philly by night one shot
The Sabbat are at the gates! Philadelphia is a city under seige, but as the battle approaches, intrigue and mystery abound. Can your coterie unravel the machinations of the Camarilla court before it is too late to stop the cities fall? Or will you throw in with the Sword of Caine, sewing destruction and seeking to overthrow the puppets of the ancient ones?
